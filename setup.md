You need to download some files to follow this lesson by yourself:

- Download http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/data-shell.zip and move the file to your Desktop.
- Unzip/extract the file. You should end up with a new folder called data-shell on your Desktop.
- Open a terminal and type cd, then press the Enter key. That last step will make sure you start with your home folder as your working directory.
