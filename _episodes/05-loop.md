title: "Loops"
teaching: 1
exercises: 1
questions:
- "How can I perform the same actions on many different files?"
objectives:
- "Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files."
- "Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop."
- "Explain the difference between a variable's name and its value."
- "Explain why spaces and some punctuation characters shouldn't be used in file names."
- "Demonstrate how to see what commands have recently been executed."
- "Re-run recently executed commands without retyping them."
keypoints:
- "A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list."
- "Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on."
- "Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used."
- "Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion."
- "Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping."
- "Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them."
- "Use `Ctrl-R` to search through the previously entered commands."
- "Use `history` to display recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number."

**Loops** are key to productivity improvements through automation as they allow us to execute
commands repetitively. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the
amount of typing (and typing mistakes).  Even though they are an important tool, they are not critical to using Pawsey.
